<h2 style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="introduction" id="introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
The Fourier Transform is an important tool in Image Processing, and
is directly related to filter theory, since a filter, which is a
convolution in the spatial domain (=the image), is a simple
multiplication in the spectral domain (= the FT of the
image)!<br />
<br />
Most other tutorials about Fourier Transforms of images are in
boring greyscale. Even, many programs and plugins available that
can calculate the FT on images only support greyscale. In times
where 24 and 32 bit color are getting old, we cannot accept this
any longer! This tutorial is in 24-bit <span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">c</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">o</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">l</span><span style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">o</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 102, 51);">r</span>, by doing the FT on each colorchannel separately. Here's an example where the FT of an image is used to make a tillable grass texture look better:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fixthegrass.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 281px;" /><br />
<br />
There is also another way to calculate the FT of color images however, by using quaternions instead of complex numbers, which can convert an image of 4 channels to another image with 4 channels.<br />
<br />
Before beginning with the Fourier Transform on images, which is the 2D version of the FT, we'll start with the easier 1D FT, which is often used for audio and electromagnetical signals.<br />
<br />
To fully understand this tutorial, it'd be interesting to know about complex numbers, their magnitude (amplitude), and argument (phase). If you'd like to learn more about these, there's an appendix about complex numbers (one of the other html files), or find a tutorial with google.<br />
<br />
The following two source files can be downloaded to have all the code described:<br />

<h2><a name="libraries" id="libraries"></a>Libraries<br /></h2>

This tutorial contains demo code for computing the Fourier Transform, however if you would like
to use the Fourier Transform for any real application, there are better and faster libraries out
there so I really recommend using those, and use the code in this tutorial only to follow along.
<p>
Specifically, the Fast Fourier Transform code further down in this tutorial only supports
power-of-two sized inputs, while good libraries can do FFT on arbitrary sizes.
<p>
Here are a few good free libraries (carefully note which license they have to check if you can use it in your project):
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fftw.org/">FFTW</a> "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West", GPL license</li>
<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kissfft/">Kiss FFT</a> "Keep It Simple, Stupid FFT", BSD license, very small so easy to import</li>
<li><a href="http://www.fftw.org/benchfft/ffts.html">More...</a>: FFTW's website has a very good list of other libraries on its benchmark page</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="signals" id="signals"></a>Signals and Spectra<br /></h2>

Before starting with the Fourier Transform, an introduction about
Signals and Spectra is in place. As signals, for now consider
signals in the time, like audio and electromagnetic signals. If you
plot such a signal in function of time, a simple signal could look
like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/signal1.gif" style="width: 639px; height: 62px;" /><br />
<br />
This is a sine wave, so if this'd be an audio signal, you'd hear a
pure tone with only 1 frequency (like the beep of a PC speaker, or
a very pure flute). The grey curve behind the red curve represents
the amplitude of the signal, which is always positive.<br />
<br />
The spectrum of a signal contains for every frequency, how much of
this frequency is in the signal. Since the signal above is a sine,
it has only one frequency, so the spectrum would be very simple:
only one value will be positive (= the frequency of the sine
curve), and all others are zero. So the spectrum would have a
single peak. A spectrum has two sides however: the negative side on
the left, and the positive side on the right. The negative side
contains negative frequencies. For real signals (with no imaginary
part), like audio signals are, the negative side of the spectrum is
always a mirrored version of the positive side. So for the sine
signal above, the positive side will have a single peak, and this
peak will be mirrored in the negative side. This is what its
spectrum looks like:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum1.gif" style="width: 639px; height: 181px;" /><br />
<br />
The white curve represents the amplitude of the signal. The red and
green curve represent the real and imaginary part of the spectrum,
respectively, but a spectrum is raraly represented that way.
Normally, both the amplitude and <span style="font-style: italic;">phase</span> of a spectrum are given, but
since there's not that much interesting info for us in it now, the
phase isn't included.<br />
<br />
Let's study another example now: the same sine, but with a DC
component added: sin(x)+C. The name DC component comes from
electronics, where it stands for Direct Current (as opposed to
Alternating Current). The DC component in any signal, is the time
average of it. A sine signal has time average 0, but if however,
you add a constant to the sine, the signals time average will
become that constant. This adding of the constant, results in the
sine signal being raised higher above the horizontal axis:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/signal2.gif" style="width: 638px; height: 83px;" /><br />
<br />
Such a constant, or DC component, has frequency 0. So we can expect
that the spectrum will get an extra peak at the origin, and indeed,
it has:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2.gif" style="width: 630px; height: 191px;" /><br />
<br />
So, if the spectrum of a signal is non-zero at the origin, you know
that its time average isn't zero and it has a DC component! The
further away from the origin to the left or right a peak is, the
higher the frequency it represents, so a peak far to the right (and
left) means that the signal contains a high frequency component.
Note that an audio signal never has a DC component, since nobody
can produce or hear it. Electrical signals can have it
however.<br />
<br />
Now let's look at a signal which is the sum of two sine functions:
the second sine function has the double frequency of the first, so
the curve has the shape sin(x)+sin(2*x):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/signal3.gif" style="width: 634px; height: 71px;" /><br />
<br />
Since there are now two sines with two different frequencies, we
can expect two peaks on the positive side of the spectrum (and two
more on the negative side since it's the mirrored version):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum3.gif" style="width: 634px; height: 111px;" /><br />
<br />
If the two sines both have a different phase (i.e. one of the two
sines is shifted horizontally), the amplitude of the spectum will
still be the same, only the phase will be different, but the phase
isn't shown here.<br />
<br />
Arbitrary sound signals, such as a spoken word, consist of an
infinite sum (or integral) of infinitely much sine functions, all
with a different frequency, and all with their own amplitude and
phase, and the spectrum is the perfect plot to view how much of
each frequency is in the signal. Such a spectrum won't just have a
few peaks, but will be a continuous function.<br />
<br />
There are a few special functions with a special spectrum:<br />
<br />
The Dirac impuls is a signal that is zero everywhere, except at the
origin, where it's infinite. That is the ideal version for
continuous functions, for a discrete function on a computer it can
as well be represented as a single peak with finite height at the
origin.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/signal4.gif" style="width: 636px; height: 89px;" /><br />
<br />
Such a peak sounds like a popping sound in an audio signal, and
contains ALL frequencies. That's why its spectrum looks like this
(the horizontal black line):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum4.gif" style="width: 636px; height: 72px;" /><br />
<br />
The spectrum is positive everywhere, so every frequency is
contained in the signal. This also means that, to get such a peak
as a sum of sine functions, you have to add infinitely much
elementary sine functions all with the same amplitude, and all
shifted with a certain phase, they'll cancel each other out, except
at the origin, hence the peak.<br />
<br />
Note that it's possible to intepret the spectrum as a time signal
(a constant DC signal), and that then the red function can be seen
as its spectrum (a peak at zero, since a DC signal has frequency
0). This duality is one of the interesting properties of the
Fourier Transform as we'll see later.<br />
<br />
Finally, another special signal is the sinc(x) function; sinc(x) =
sin(x)/x:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/signal5.gif" style="width: 634px; height: 133px;" /><br />
<br />
Its spectrum is a rectangular pulse (here only an approximation of
it because the spectrum was calculated using only 128
points):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum5.gif" style="width: 636px; height: 95px;" /><br />
<br />
Again because of the duality between a signal and its spectrum, a
rectangular time signal will have a sinc function as its
spectrum.<br />
<br />
Spectra are also used to study the color of light. These are
exactly the same thing, since light too is a 1-dimensional signal
containing different frequencies, some of which the eye happens to
be sensitive to. The spectrum shows for every frequency, how much
of it is in the light, just the same as the audio spectrum does for
audio signals.<br />
<br />
An MP3 player like Winamp also shows the spectrum of the audio
signal it's playing (but it varies with time because they calculate
the spectrum each time again for the last few milliseconds), and
spectra of audio signals can be used to detect bass, treble and
vocals in music, for speach recognition, audio filters, etc...
Since this is a tutorial about computer graphics, I won't go any
deeper in this however.<br />
<br />
Often, the spectrum is drawn on a logarithmical scale instead of a
linear one like here, then the amplitude is expressed in decibels
(dB).<br style="font-weight: bold;" />


<h2><a name="fourier" id="fourier"></a>The Fourier Transform</h2>

So how do you calculate the spectrum of a given signal? With the
Fourier Transform!<br />
<br />
The Continuous Fourier Transform, for use on continuous signals, is
defined as follows:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/CFT.gif" style="width: 233px; height: 77px;" /><br />
<br />
And the Inverse Continuous Fourier Transform, which allows you to
go from the spectrum back to the signal, is defined as:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ICFT.gif" style="width: 223px; height: 71px;" /><br />
<br />
F(w) is the spectrum, where w represents the frequency, and f(x) is
the signal in the time where x represents the time. i is sqrt(-1),
see complex number theory.<br />
<br />
Note the similarity between both transforms, which explains the
duality between a signal and its spectrum.<br />
<br />
A computer can't work with continuous signals, only with finite
discrete signals. Those are finite in time, and have only a
discrete set of points (i.e. the signal is sampled). One of the
properties of the Fourier Transform and its inverse is, that the
FT of a discrete signal is periodic. Since for a computer both the
signal and the specrum must be discrete, both the signal and
spectrum will be periodic. But by taking only one period of it, we
get our finite signal. So if you're taking the DFT of a signal or
an image on the computer, mathematicaly speaking, that signal is
infinitely repeated, or the image infinitely tiled, and so is the
spectrum. A nice property is that both the signal and the spectrum
will have the same number of discrete points, so the DFT of an
image of 128*128 pixels will also have 128*128 pixels.<br />
<br />
Since the signal is finite in time, the infinite borders of the
integrals can be replaced by finite ones, and the integral symbol
can be replaced by a sum. So the DFT is defined as:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/DFT.gif" style="width: 169px; height: 73px;" /><br />
<br />
And the inverse as:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/IDFT.gif" style="width: 171px; height: 66px;" /><br />
<br />
This looks already much more programmable on a computer, to program
the FT, you have to do the calculation for every n, so you get a
double for loop (one for every n, and one for every k, which is the
sum). The exponential of the imaginary number can be replaced by a
cos and a sin by using the famous formula e^ix = cosx + isinx. More
on programming it follows further in this tutorial.<br />
<br />
There are multiple definitions of the DFT, for example you can also
do the division through N in the forward DFT instead of the inverse
one, or divide through sqrt(N) in both. To plot it on a computer,
the best result is gotten by dividing through N in the forward
DFT.


<h2><a name="properties" id="properties"></a>Properties of The Fourier Transform</h2>

A signal is often denoted with a small letter, and its fourier
transform or spectrum with a capital letter. The relatoin between a
signal and its spectrum is often denoted with <span style="font-family: monospace;">f(x) &lt;--&gt; F(w)</span>, with the
signal on the left and its spectrum on the right.<br />
<br />
The Fourier Transform has some interesting properties, some of
which make it easier to understand why spectra of certain signals
have a certain shape.<br />
<br />
Don't take this as a proper list however, some scaling factors like
2*pi are left away, they're not that important and can be left away
or depending if you use frequency or pulsation. Handbooks of Sigal
Processing and sites like Wikipedia and Mathworld contain much more
complete and mathematically correct tables of FT properties. We're
most interested in the shape of the functions and not the
scale.<br />
<br />
<b>Linearity</b><br />
<br />
<tt>f(x)+g(x) &lt;--&gt; F(w)+G(w)</tt><br />
<br />
<tt>a*f(x) &lt;--&gt; a*F(w)</tt><br />
<br />
This means that if you add/substract two signals, their spectra are
added/substracted as wall, and if you increase/decrease the
amplitude of the signal, the amplitude of its spectrum will be
increased/decreased with the same factor.<br />
<br />
<b>Scaling</b><br />
<br />
<tt>f(a*x) &lt;--&gt; (1/a) * F(w/a)</tt><br />
<br />
This means that if you make the function wider in the x-direction,
its spectrum will become smaller in the x-direction, and vica
versa. The amplitude will also be changed.<br />
<br />
<b>Time Shifting</b><br />
<br />
<tt>f(x-x0) &lt;--&gt; (exp(-i*w*x0)) * F(w)</tt><br />
<br />
Since the only thing that happens if you shift the time, is a
multiplication of the Fourier Transform with the exponential of an
imaginary number, you won't see the difference of a time shift in
the amplitude of the spectrum, only in the phase.<br />
<br />
<b>Frequency Shifting</b><br />
<br />
<tt>(exp(-i*w0*x))*f(x)&lt;--&gt;F(w-w0)</tt><br />
<br />
This is the dual of the time shifting.<br />
<br />
<b>Duality or Symmetry</b><br />
<br />
<tt>if f(x) &lt;--&gt; F(w)<br />
then F(x) &lt;--&gt; f(-w)</tt><br />
<br />
Apart from some scaling factors at least. Because of this property,
for example, the spectrum of a rectangular pulse is a sinc function
and at the same time the spectrum of a sinc function is a
rectangular pulse.<br />
<br />
<b>Symmetry Rules</b><br />
<br />
These are only a few of the symmetry rules:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>The Fourier Transform of a real even signal is real and even
(i.e. it's symmetrical, mirrored around the y-axis)</li>
<li>The Fourier Transform of a real odd signal is imaginary and odd
(odd means it's assymetrical, mirrored around the origin
point)</li>
<li>Since arbitrary real signals are always a sum of an even and an
odd function, the Fourier Transform of a real signal has an even
real part and an odd imaginary part, and the Amplitude is thus
always symmetrical.</li>
<li>In the same way, the amplitude of FT's of pure imaginary
signals are symmetrical, but the FT of complex signals isn't always
symmetrical.</li>
</ul>
<b>Convolution Theorem</b><br />
<br />
Convolution is an operation between two functions that is defined
as an integral, but can also be explained as follows:<br />
<br />
Take 2 functions, for example two rectangle functions f1(x) and
f2(x). Keep one of the rectangles at a fixed position. Mirror the
second one around the y axis (this doesn't have a lot of effect on
a rectangle). Then shift this second function over a value u, where
u goes from -infinity to +infinity.<br />
<br />
The resulting function g(u), the convolution of f1(x) and f2(x),
takes u as a parameter. For a certain u, multiply f1 and the
shifted and mirrored f2 with each other, and take area under the
result (by integrating it). This area is the value of g(u) for that
u! This has to be done for every u to know the complete result. For
example, for the two rectangle functions, as we start at
u=-infinity, g(u) is 0 because the two rectangles don't overlap,
and multiplication of the two functions will thus result in the
zero function, which has zero area. As u moves to the right, g(u)
will remain 0 all the time, until finally the two rectangles start
overlapping. Now the more we go to the right, the larger the area
will become, until it reaches its maximum, so g(u) is rising.
Then, the rectangles are overlapping less and less again as the
second one moves more to the right, and the value of g(u) decreases
again. Finally g(u) reaches zero again and remains so until
+infinity. The resulting g(u) is thus a triangle function.<br />
<br />
This is what filters of painting programs that don't use the FT do
in 2D. The image is then the function that remains at fixed
position, while the filter matrix moves around the whole image, and
you calculate the value of every pixel by multiplying every element
of the matrix with every corresponding pixel of the image the
matrix overlaps. For large filter matrices this is a lot of work.
You can create your own filter matrices in painting programs like
Paint Shop Pro and Photoshop by using the "User Defined"
filter.<br />
<br />
Correlation is almost the same as convolution, except you don't
have to mirror the second function.<br />
<br />
The convolution theorem sais that, convolving two functions in the
time domain corresponds to multiplying their spectra in the fourier
domain, and vica versa. This multiplication is a much easier
operation than convolution.<br />
<br />
Since filters, too, can be described in the time and the fourier
domain (called the impulse response and transfer function of the
filter respectively), and linear filters do a convolutoin in the
time domain, in the frequency domain this corresponds to
multiplying the transfer function of the filter with the spectrum
of the signal. The impulse response of the filter in the time
domain is the response of the filter to a dirac impuls (see
earlier), and the transfer function of the filter is the Fourier
Transform of the impulse response.<br />
<br />
For us, the Convolution Theorem will come in handy when we
experiment with the Fourier Transformations of signals and
images.<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="coding1d" id="coding1d"></a>Programming The 1D Fourier Transform</h2>

Here's the code of a simple program that'll calculate the FT of a
given signal, and will plot both the signal and the FT. Put it in
the main.cpp file.<br />
<br />
First the variables and functions are declared. N will be the
number of discrete points in the signal. For the signal and its
spectrum, respectively a small f or g and capital F or G are used,
as it's also done in mathematics.<br />

<br />
It takes 4 arrays as parameters: *gRe and *gIm to read from (these
are the real and imaginary part of the signal), and *GRe and *GIm
to write the results to (these are the FT of the signal). Both the
input and output are complex numbers, which is why two arrays (a
real and an imaginary one) are needed. n is the size of the signal
(and the arrays), so it's the number of discrete points in the
signal.<br />
<br />
The first for loop with w going from 0 to n-1 means that a
calculation is needed for every single point of the result. The
second for loop, with x going from 0 to n, means that every point
of the input signal needs to be taken in account, it's the sum from
the mathematical definition of the DFT. The exponential function is
changed by the formula e^ix = cosx + isinx, and the real and
imaginary part are calculated seperatly. Afterwards the values are
divided through n, so that the values are reasonably small enough
to plot them on the screen.<br />
<br />
By setting "inverse" to true, it can also calculate the IDFT
(Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform), but this isn't used in this
example. The only differences are a different sign in the
exponential function and no division through n.<br />
<br />
Next, the plot function takes a single array as parameter, and will
draw the signal or spectrum contained in this array on screen with
a color you want using lines and filled circles. You can also use a
parameter "shift" to bring the edges to the center and vica versa.
This is useful for a better representation of the Fourier
Transform: normally the result of the DFT has the low frequency
components on the sides, and the highest frequency in the center.
Since the result is in fact periodic, bringing the sides to the
center is the same as moving the plot half a period.<br />

And finally, the function calculateAmp calculates the amplitude
given the real and imaginary part, so you can plot the amplitude
too.<br />

The output of this program is as follows:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/1ddft.gif" style="width: 644px; height: 505px;" /><br />
<br />
The red function is the input function, which is a sine, and the
black funtion at the bottom is the amplitude of its spectrum,
which is calculated by the DFT function. The green curves are the
imaginary parts.<br />
<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="fft" id="fft"></a>The Fast Fourier Transform</h2>

The above DFT function correctly calculates the Discrete Fourier
Transform, but uses two for loops of n times, so it takes
O(n&sup2;) arithmetical operations. A faster algorithm is the Fast
Fourier Transform or FFT, which uses only O(n*logn) operations.
This makes a big difference for very large n: if n would be 1024,
the DFT function would take 1048576 (about 1 million) loops,
while the FFT would use only 10240.<br />
<br />
The FFT works by splitting the signal into two halves: one halve
contains all the values with even index, the other all the ones
with odd index. Then, it splits up these two halves again, etc...,
recursivily. Due to this, a requirement is that the size of the
signal, n, must be a power of 2. The algorithm described here is the
Radix-2 Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm (developed by Cooley and Tukey in 1965).
<p>
There exist other algorithms that can operate fast on signals with other sizes
than a power of two, even large primes. For example mixed-radix Cooley-Tukey as well as others. However,
this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. The code linked to in the
<a href="fourier.html#libraries">Libraries</a> section above supports non-powers of two so I would
recommend using a library like those for real life applications. But for this tutorial,
we continue with much simpler code for the demonstration.<br />
<br />
Here's a new version of the DFT function, called FFT, which uses
the radix-2 algorithm described above. You
can add it to the previous program and change the function call of
it to FFT to test it out.<br />
<br />
First, this function will calculate the logarithm of n, needed for
the algorithm.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">void FFT(int n, bool inverse, const double *gRe, const double *gIm, double *GRe, double *GIm)
{
  //Calculate m=log_2(n)
  int m = 0;
  int p = 1;
  while(p &lt; n)
  {
    p *= 2;
    m++;
  }</span></pre>
</td>

</center>
<br />
Next, Bit Reversal is performed. Because of the way the FFT works,
by splitting the signal in its even and odd components every time,
the algorithm requires that the input signal is already in the form
where all odd components come first, then the even ones, and so on
in each of the halves. This is the same as reversing the bits of
the index of each value (for example the second value, with index
0001 will now get index 1000 and this go to the center), hence the
name.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">  //Bit reversal
  GRe[n - 1] = gRe[n - 1];

  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n - 1; i++)
  {
    GRe[i] = gRe[j];
    GIm[i] = gIm[j];
    int k = n / 2;
    while(k &lt;= j)
    {
      j -= k;
      k /= 2;
    }
    j += k;
  }</span></pre>

</center>
<br />
Next the actual FFT is performed. Mathematically speaking it's a
recursive function, but this is a modified version to work
non-recursively, it'd be way too hard to pass complete arrays to a
recursive function every time. ca and sa still represent the cosine
and sine, but are calculated with the half-angle formulas and
initual values -1.0 and 0.0 (cos and sin of pi): each loop, ca and
sa represent the cosine and sine of half the angle as the previous
loop.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">  //Calculate the FFT
  double ca = -1.0;
  double sa = 0.0;
  int l1 = 1, l2 = 1;
  for(int l = 0; l &lt; m; l++)
  {
    l1 = l2;
    l2 *= 2;
    double u1 = 1.0;
    double u2 = 0.0;
    for(int j = 0; j &lt; l1; j++)
    {
      for(int i = j; i &lt; n; i += l2)
      {
        int i1 = i + l1;
        double t1 = u1 * GRe[i1] - u2 * GIm[i1];
        double t2 = u1 * GIm[i1] + u2 * GRe[i1];
        GRe[i1] = GRe[i] - t1;
        GIm[i1] = GIm[i] - t2;
        GRe[i] += t1;
        GIm[i] += t2;
      }
      double z =  u1 * ca - u2 * sa;
      u2 = u1 * sa + u2 * ca;
      u1 = z;
    }
    sa = sqrt((1.0 - ca) / 2.0);
    if(!inverse) sa =- sa;
    ca = sqrt((1.0 + ca) / 2.0);
  }</span></pre>

</center>
<br />
Finally, the values are divided through n if it isn't the inverse DFT.<br />
<br />
<center>
<table class="codetable">
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">  //Divide through n if it isn't the IDFT
  if(!inverse)
  for(int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
  {
    GRe[i] /= n;
    GIm[i] /= n;
  }
}</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<br />
The function reads from *gRe and *gIm again and stores the result
in *GRe and *GIm.<br />
<br />
There are 3 nested loops now in the FFT part, but only the first
one goes from 0 to n-1, the other two together only loop log_2(n)
times. For this small signal of only 128 values you probably won't
notice any increase in speed because both DFT and FFT are
calculated instantly (unless you're working on some computer from
the '40s), but on bigger signals, on 2D signals, and in
applications where the FT has be be calculated over and over in
real time, it'll make an important difference.<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="filters1d" id="filters1d"></a>Filters</h2>

In the Fourier Domain, it's easy to apply some filters. All you
have to do is multiply the spectrum with the transfer function of
the filter.<br />
<br />
Low pass filters only let through components with low frequencies
(for example the bass from music), while High Pass filters let only
components with high frequencies through. You can also make Band
Pass and Band Stop filters, which let through or block components
with a certain frequency. Amplifiers multiply the whole spectrum
with a constant value, and you can of course make filters that
amplify certain frequencies, or triangular filters that weaken
higher frequencies more and more, etc...<br />
<br />
So to make for example a Low Pass filter, multiply the spectrum
with a rectangular function with the rectangle around the origin.
All the low frequency components will then be kept, while the high
ones are multiplied by zero and are thus filtered away.<br />
<br />
Here's a part of code for a program that'll first allow you to
select different signals and watch their FT, and after pressing the
space key, will allow you to choose different filters on the
spectrum, and it'll calculate the inverse FT to see how the
original signal is affected by the filter.<br />
<br />

The main function starts here. It enters the first loop, this loop
will allow you to choose a function. The parameters p1 and p2 can
be changed to modify the amplitude and/or width of some of the

This is inside the loop after it has read the keys. Every key has
another action assiciated to it to create a certain function, for
example if you press the g key (SDLK_g) it'll put a sum of two
sines in fRe[x]. The arrow keys also have some actions to set the
imaginary part to 0, equal to the real part, or a modified version
of the real part. Finally, the space keys sets "endloop" to true so
that the first loop will end.<br />

Now the keys all change the spectrum in a certain way: they'll

around the origin. High Pass filters (HP) do the oposite.<br />

The functions FFT, plot and calculateAmp are identical to the ones
explained earlier and aren't included here anymore.<br />
<br />
There's not much new in this code, the functions FFT, plot and
calculateAmp are still the same, but by playing with this program
you can see the effects of Low Pass (LP), High Pass (HP) and a few
other filters. Just follow the instructions on screen.<br />
<br />
For example, here, a signal which is the sum of 5 sines and a DC
component (gotten by pressing the "p" key) is shown together with
its spectrum, and then, respectively, a LP and a HP are applied to
it:<br />
<br />
The original signal:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/filter1.gif" style="width: 638px; height: 278px;" /><br />
<br />
An LP Filter:<br />
<img alt="" src="images/filter2.gif" style="width: 639px; height: 238px;" /><br />
<br />
A HP Filter<br />
<img alt="" src="images/filter3.gif" style="width: 637px; height: 145px;" /><br />
Here, the same is done with a step function (gotten by pressing the "e" key):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/filter4.gif" style="width: 639px; height: 304px;" /><br />
An LP filter on it:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/filter5.gif" style="width: 638px; height: 323px;" /><br />
<br />
A HP filter on it. This filter filters out almost only the DC component, so two almost-flat lines remain in the signal:<br />

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="dft2d" id="dft2d"></a>2D Fourier Transform on Images</h2>

The extension of the Fourier Transform to 2D is actually pretty
simple. First you take the 1D FT of every row of the image, and
then on this result you take the 1D FT of every column.<br />
<br />
This can be done by doing FT row by row on the image with the 1D FT function, then transpose the image (so what were columns are now rows), then do again the 1D FT on each row,
and then transpose the image again to have the original direction. This has the advantage the memory you're operating on is closer together for better caching for the CPU (faster),
but requires a transpose operation in between. Another way is to extend the 1D FT function to take a "stride" parameter, which is the step in memory between successive values
we're currently working on. The stride is then set to the row size to work on a column, or to 1 to work on rows. In addition, because we have 3 color channels,
we multiply the stride by 3. This is slightly simpler so we'll use this method in this tutorial.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here follows the code of a program that does exactly that, and two
alternative functions that do the same are given in it: one will
use the 2D version of the slow DFT, and the other the 2D version of
the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The program will first calculate
the FT of the image, and then calculate the Inverse FT of the
result, to check if the formula is working correctly: if it gives
back the original it works. You can freely change between calls to
<tt>DFT2D()</tt> and <tt>FFT2D()</tt> in the main function, and
you'll notice that the <tt>DFT2D()</tt> function is very slow now,
while the <tt>FFT2D()</tt> function works very fast.<br />
<br />
Because an RGB image has 3 color channels, the FT is calculated for
each color channel separately, so in fact 3 greyscale FT's are
calculated.<br />
<br />
The program requires that there's a 24-bit color, 128*128 PNG
image pics/test.png (path relative to the program). There is one in <a href="files/photos.zip">photos.zip</a><br />.
<br />
First again all the variables and functions are declared.<br />
W and H are the width and height of the image in pixels.<br />
The arrays for the signal and its spectrum are now 3-dimensional:
2 dimensions for the size, and 1 dimension for the RGB color
components. The class ColorRGB can't be used here because more
precision is required for FT, that's why the color components are
put in a double array instead; index 0 represents red, index 1
green, and index 2 is blue.<br />
<br />
There are two versions of the FT functions here, the slow DFT2D and
the fast FFT2D.<br />

The main function first loads an image, and then sets the signal to
that image.<br />
<br />
Next, it draws the image. It draws the real part, the imaginary
part (which is 0!), and the amplitude, which looks the same as the
real part.<br />
<br />
Then it calculates the FT of the image, by using the DFT2D
function, but you can as well change this to FFT2D instead: it'll
go faster then. Then it draws the just calculated spectrum.<br />
<br />
Finally, it calculates the inverse FT of that spectrum again and
draws the result, this is only to check if the functions are
working correctly: if you get the original image back, they
are.<br />

Here we have the 1D DFT function again, but this time with a stride and factor parameter added. The stride
parameter, as explained above, allows a larger step, to allow working on columns and color channels in our
3D array. The factor is there because we need control over what values (rather than just n) to divide the
result with.<br />

The DFT2D function, then, calls the 2D DFT function for each row, and for
each column, and this separately for every color component. The function takes
now two parameters for the dimensions: w and h (sometimes also called n and m), because an image is 2D. The
parameter inverse can be set to true to do the inverse calculations
instead. Again *gRe and *gIm are the input arrays, and *GRe and
*GIm the output arrays. In this 2D version, the values are divided
through h for the normal DFT and through w for the inverse DFT.
There are also definitions where you should divide through h*w in
one direction and through 1 in the other, or though sqrt(h*w) in
both, but it doesn't really matter which one you pick, as long as
the forward FT and the inverse together give the original image
back. Using roughly the square root of h*w in each direction, though, gives
a similar range of values as the input image so is nicest to draw.<br />

The draw function does what the plot function did in the 1D
version: show the signal on screen. Now this function will draw the
signal or spectrum arrays you feed it as a 24-bit RGB image with
the upper left corner at xpos,yPos. The shift parameter can be used
to bring the corners to the center and the center to the corners,
useful for FT's to bring the DC component to the center. The neg128
parameter can be used to draw images that can have negative pixel
values: now gray (RGB color 128, 128, 128) is used as 0, darker
colors are negative, and brighter ones are positive.<br />

Note that, because of the way C++ works, the arrays are passed to
the functions in a special way, and inside the functions they have
to be treated as 1-dimensional.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that above code is not at all optimal but kept simple for demonstration. Much faster libraries exist to do this,
such as FFTW, kissfft and others. These are much faster, more complete, and support non-power-of-two sizes fast as well.
Using such a well tested fast implementation is recommended for real life problems.
<br />
<br />
The output of the program is as follows:<br />
<br />
<img alt="2D DFT" src="images/DFT2D.jpg" style="width: 388px; height: 406px;" /><br />
<br />
On the top row are the real part, imaginary part and amplitude of
the image. The imaginary part of the image is 0.<br />
<br />
On the center row are the real part, imaginary part and amplitude
of the spectrum from the image. The real and imaginary part can
have negative values, so they have the "neg128" option enabled to
draw them and grey represents 0. Since the amplitude is always
positive, black is 0 there.<br />
<br />
The bottom row is again the image, calculated by using the Inverse
DFT of the spectrum. It looks almost the same as the original, a
few pixels might slightly differ in color due to rounding
errors.<br />
<br />
The text "99% done" only appears if you use the DFT2D function,
since it's so slow (30 seconds on an Athlon 1700+ processor for an
128x128 image) a progress counter is handy. The FFT2D does the same
calculation immediatly, so such a counter isn't needed.<br />
<br />
If you study the spectra of the images, you'll see horizontal and
vertical lines through the center. They're caused by the sides of
the image: since mathematically speaking, the FT is calculated of
the image tiled infinite times, there's an abrupt change when going
from one side of the image to the other, causing the lines in the
spectrum.<br />
<br />
<b>Some remarks:</b><br />
<ul>
<li>If you'd calculate the forward FT instead of the inverse FT to
go back from the spectrum to the image, you get the image upside
down.</li>
<li>Both the real and imaginary part of the spectrum are needed to
reconstruct the image out of it, even though the image itself has
no imaginary part.</li>
<li>The FT functions also work on images that have an imaginary
part, for example if a color image would have only 2 color
channels, one color channel could be used as real part and the
other as imaginary part.</li>
<li>Even though the image itself is in 24-bit color, which means
that each pixel has 8 bit per color channel, or 256 discrete color
values per channel, the FT of it requires much more precision: both
the real and imaginary component require floating point numbers
that can go from -infinity to +infinity. Otherwise you'll lose
information and the image you get back after doing the inverse FT
on it again will look very crappy. The spectra displayed on the
computer screen don't contain all information, since they're
converted back to integers with 256 discrete values.</li>
<li>By taking the DFT of the amplitude of the spectrum of an image,
you will NOT get the original image back at all, since it requires
a high precision real and an imaginary part of the spectrum, not
the amplitude.</li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="spectra2d" id="spectra2d"></a>The Spectra of Images</h2>

You can replace test.png by any 24-bit 128*128 color PNG you
want. You can even use another size, but then you'll have to change
the parameters N and M in the code (on top). Note that the FFT2D
function only works on images with a size that is a power of two
(64x64, 128x256, 256x256... all work), otherwise you'll have to use
the slower DFT2D function (or a good other FFT library that supports non power of two).<br />
<br />
The spectrum of an image isn't immediatly the most interesting
thing (applying filters on it and then taking the inverse FT again
is much more interesting), but you can still learn a bit about an
image by looking at its spectrum: here are a few examples, each
picture shows the real part of the image, and the amplitude of the
spectrum. To see the real and imaginary part of the spectrum, run
the images through the program yourself.<br />
<br />
This image is a sine function with a DC component added (because
images can only have positive pixel values): the color of each
pixel is 128 + 128 * sin(pi*y/16.0). If you remember the spectra of
1D signals, you'll remember that a sine function gave a peak on the
negative and positive side, and that the DC component gave a peak
at zero. Here you can see the same in the spectrum: the center dot
is the DC component, and the two others represent the frequency of
the sine function, the one dot is just a mirrored version of the
other one. There are no pixels in the x-direction, because the
image is the same everywhere in that direction.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d1.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Here a sine function with a higher frequency is used to generate
the image, so the two dots are further away from the origin to
represent the higher frequency. Remember the scale property of the
Fourier Transform? Here it's illustrated very well: the image
contracts, and its spectrum becomes wider.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d2.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
In the next image, the sine function doesn't tile: if you'd put the
same image twice on top of each other, you wouldn't see a sine
anymore in the y-direction (while in the previous two examples you
would). This isn't considered a real sine anymore by the spectrum
either, and it doesn't contain just two dots, but a line.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d3.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
One of the properties of the 2D FT is that if you rotate the image,
the spectrum will rotate in the same direction:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d4.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
The following image shows the sum of 2 sine functions, each in
another direction (Plasma effects are often made this way):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d5.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
The following image shows how lines in an image often generate
perpendicular lines in the spectrum:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d6.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
The sloped lines in the spectrum here are obviously due to the
sharp transition from the sky to the mountain.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d7.jpg" style="width: 255px; height: 127px;" /><br />
<br />
The FT of a rectangular function is a 2D sinc function:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d8.jpg" style="width: 265px; height: 127px;" /><br />
<br />
And here's the FT of a tillable texture, since it's tillable there
are no abrupt changes on the horizontal and vertical sides, so
there are no horizontal and vertical lines in the spectrum:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/spectrum2d9.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="filters2d" id="filters2d"></a>2D Filters</h2>

Now comes the most interesting application of the FT on images: you
can easily apply all sorts of filters to the spectrum, again by
multiplying them with a 2D transfer function, or by making some
parts of the spectrum zero, or just applying some whacko formula to
the spectrum. After doing that, take the inverse FT of the modified
spectrum to get the filtered image.<br />
<br />
Here's part of the code for a program that'll allow you to select
different images (a PNG, modified versions of it, and some
generated functions), and then after pressing space, allows you to
apply different filters and see their effect. The full code can be
downloaded <a href="files/fourier2d.cpp">here</a>: <a href="files/fourier2d.cpp">fourier2d.cpp</a>.<br />
<br />
This code doesn't contain much new, it's much more interesting to
run it and study the results of the filters.<br />
<br />
Once again, first come all the declarations of functions and
variables. f2 and F2 will become the buffers for the filtered
versions of the original image and spectrum.<br />

<br />
The functions FFT2D, draw and calculateAmp are the same as before
again and not shown here. They're also in the downloadable
file.<br />
<br />
Here's a possible output of the program:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/2dfilters.jpg" style="width: 387px; height: 543px;" /><br />
<br />
The top row shows the original image, below that is its spectrum
(the amplitude on the right), the third row shows the spectrum with
a low pass filter applied to it: only the low frequency components
remain. The bottom row shows the result of the Inverse FT on the
new spectrum: all high frequency components of the image are
removed, and the image becomes blurred.<br />
<br />
Here's another example, which shows what happens if you set the
imaginary part of the spectrum to 0. To get this, first press space
and then press the b key in the program.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/2dfilters2.jpg" style="width: 390px; height: 545px;" /><br />
<br />
More on different types of filters follows in the next
sections.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span>


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="dc" id="dc"></a>The DC Component<br /></h2>

The center of the spectrum is the DC component of the picture, and
represents the average color of the picture: if you calculate the
IDFT of a spectrum with only the DC component left, you get a flat
image with only one color: the average of the original image. In
the program for which the code was given above, first accept the
image by pressing space, and then you can add or remove the DC
component by using the arrow keys, get the full spectrum again by
pressing the a key (or the q key on azerty keyboards), and make the
spectrum zero by pressing the m key (the , key on azerty
keyboards). To get only the DC component, first press m to remove
the spectrum, then the up arrow to get only the DC component
back.<br />
<br />
This is the original image (the bright blue line in the spectrum
probably comes from the sharp edges from the cooling fin):<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/theoriginal.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Here's the same image with the DC component removed (note the black
dot in the center of the spectrum). You can't see the whole story
in fact, all the parts of the image that look black are actually
negative, since this picture represents the original image with the
average color substracted from it. On the right is the amplitude of
the image instead, which reveals the negative parts.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Image with its DC component removed" src=
"images/DCremoved.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><img alt=
"The amplitude of the image with its DC component removed" src=
"images/DCremovedamplitude.jpg" style="width: 128px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
And here below only the DC component is left. Only a single dot
remains in the spectrum. It looks white on the computer screen, but
in reality it are 3 large floating point numbers that contain the
DC color information. The DC component of an image's spectrum is
usually very large, it contains the most "energy": as you could see
on the previous image, removing this single dot from the spectrum
makes the image a whole lot darker. Energy has to be understood in
terms of Information here.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Only the DC component of the image remains" src=
"images/DConly.gif" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
This is the average color of the image, you can call it the
ultimate blur, what you'd see if you were standing very far away
from the image, or what you'd get if you took the sum of the color
of all pixels, and divided the result though the total number of
pixels.<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="lowpass" id="lowpass"></a>Low Pass Filters: Blurring<br /></h2>

Low frequencies in an audio represent the bass of the music, but in
pictures, it represents the blurriest parts and gradients. Sharp
edges and lines have high frequencies.<br />
<br />
An image can be blurred by, for each pixel, calculating the weighed
average of that pixel and its neighbours, using a convolution
matrix: that's the way Photoshop and Paint Shop Pro do it, for
example, you can create such a convolution matrix with the "User
Defined" filter in these programs. But, since the convolution in
the spatial domain is the same as a multiplication in the frequency
domain, we can also blur an image, by multiplying the spectrum with
the transfer function of a low pass filter. The transfer function
of a low pass filter makes all high frequency components zero or at
least weakens them, while keeping or amplifying the low frequency
ones.<br />
<br />
For very blurry blurs, a very large convolution matrix is required,
and this would require a lot of calculations. Taking the Fast
Fourier Transform, then multiplying the spectrum, and then taking
the Inverse FFT, goes much faster for heavy blurs. You can also
create much nicers blurs easier and more intuitively by using the
spectrum<br />
<br />
The more high frequencies you remove of the spectrum, the blurrier
the image, and the more calculations would be needed in the spatial
domain:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/theoriginal.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftblur1.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftblur2.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftblur4.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftblur5.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<img alt="" src="images/DConly.gif" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
In the above images, a circular section of the spectrum is left. A much nicer blur
would be created by not using such a "sharp" circle, but a gaussian kernel, which
exponentially decreases in value from the center. That would give a gaussian blur.
<p>
You can also, for example, keep a square one, but round ones should
give nicer blurs:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftblursquare.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" />
<p>
Side note: for some types of blur, such as gaussian blur, there
are still other faster algorithms that don't require the FFT nor a large kernel,
in the case of gaussian blur you can approximate it very well by doing three
box blurs that take linear time for any size of box in a row, see the Filtering
tutorial of this series for a bit more on that.

<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="highpass" id="highpass"></a>High Pass Filters<br /></h2>

A high pass filter on an image keeps only the high frequency
components. Since, by applying a high pass filter, the DC component
of the spectrum is removed too, the resulting image can have
negative pixel values that can't get drawn. To overcome this, the
high pass filter of Photoshop adds 128 (half of the maximum value
255) to each color component the resulting pixels, so grey
represents zero. Here, we'll look at the positive part of the
image, the amplitude (revealing the negative values), and the image
with the DC component added again instead.<br />
<br />
A high pass filter is exactly the opposite of the low pass filters,
so now a circular section in the center of the spectrum is removed.
On the left is the resulting positive real part of the image, in
the center the spectrum with the circle removed, and on the right
the amplitude of the image:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fthighpass.jpg" style="width: 384px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
To see much better what's going on, add the DC component to it
again:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fthighpasswithDC.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
It can be seen that only the high frequency parts of the image are
left: subtle gradients and color changes are gone, only the edges
of objects and especially the cooling fin are still
recognisable.<br />
<br />
Photoshop, instead of adding the DC component, adds grey to the
image to make all pixels positive, so the result of the High Pass
filter in Photoshop is something like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/photoshophighpass.jpg" style="width: 137px; height: 155px;" /><br />
<br />
If we use a higher radius for the removed circle, only the very
highest frequencies remain, only the cooling fin still looks pretty
nice:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fthighpasswithDC2.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
A high pass filter can also be done by first blurring the image,
and then substracting the blurred image from the original.<br />
<br />
After seeing those pictures you might wonder if there is actually
something useful that can be done with a High Pass Filter? Well, it
can for example be used to make better tillable textures, take for
example this grass texture:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/grasstexture.jpg" style="width: 64px; height: 64px;" /><br />
<br />
If you tile it, it looks like this:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/grasstexturetiledugly.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;" /><br />
<br />
It looks pretty ugly, because there are obvious bright and dark
spots in the image, and these look very repetitive. These large
areas of bright and darker color are very low frequency components,
so they can be removed with a subtle High Pass Filter!<br />
<br />
Let's process the image to our program, apply a High Pass filter
with a very small radius to it, and bring the DC component back:
the DC component is the lowest frequency of all, just a flat color,
so it can't look repetitive, and is very important because it
contains the green color of the grass. As you can see on the third
row on the right in the screenshot, a very small circular section
of the spectrum is removed, and in the centre of the circle is a
single white point which is the DC component.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/fixthegrass.jpg" style="width: 198px; height: 281px;" /><br />
<br />
At the bottom row a new version of the grass texture appeared, that
looks already much better when tiled if you take a certain distance
from it:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/grasstexturetiledbetter.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 256px;" /><br />
<br />
You can still recognise where the sides are, because the source
image actually wasn't a perfectly tillable one. If the source image
would've been perfectly tillable, the result would've been so as
well. On a beautiful photorealistic texture of a rocky wall, with
however a large dark spot in it that makes the rocky wall
repetitive when tiled, the result of this high pass filter would've
been very useful.<br />
<br />
The source code of the program was a little bit modified to get a
high pass filter with a smaller radius under the "SDLK_j"
button.
<p>
Side note: For sharpening, too, there are even faster algorithms than with FFT,
such as using fast blur and then computing the following sum of images:
original + (original - blur) * amount. This is "unsharp masking"


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="bandpass" id="bandpass"></a>Band Pass Filters</h2>

Band Pass filters leave though only frequencies that are between a
certain lowest and a highest frequency. Your radio uses the 1D
version of this to listen to a station with a certain frequency.
Again the DC component is removed by such a filter, so we add it
again, because without it the image is too dark to see it. Here's
the original image again, and an example of such a BP filter with
DC component:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/theoriginal.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftbandpass.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 127px;" /><br />
<br />
The sum of many images like this one together (but with the DC
component added only once of course) forms the original image
again. Here's are a few more BP filters, that leave through higher
frequencies:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftbandpass2.jpg" style="width: 255px; height: 127px;" /><br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftbandpass3.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftbandpass4.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
And here's the result of a much thinner BP filter, the thinner the
BP filter, the more it can be seen how the image is a sum of sine
functions:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="images/ftbandpass5.jpg" style="width: 256px; height: 128px;" /><br />
<br />
Note: not all bandpass examples are included in the program by
default, but you can easily get them by changing numbers of the BP
filters in the code (under SDLK_r and SDLK_s in the second input
loop).<br />


<h2 style="font-weight: normal;"><a name="real" id="real"></a>Keeping it Real<br /></h2>

Up to this point, we always calculated the FT of each channel
separately, and left the imaginary part black. This is a big loss
of resources, since there are 3 unused imaginary channels.
<br />
<br />
Since the result of the FT of a real function is symmetrical in the complex domain,
half the information is in fact redundant. So it's possible to store the result of the
FT into one real array anyway: Place the DC component in the center, on one side put
one half of the real part, on the other side one half of the imaginary part.
For even sized input, there will also be one value that is zero in the imaginary part and
has some non-zero value in the real part. That one value can go in the remaining index. This
transform is perfectly reversible, but it requires taking care of indices correctly. Providing
the code here is currently beyond the scope of this already long tutorial.
<br />
<br />
Another way to avoid complex numbers is to use a real transform, such as the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform).
Several similar such transforms exist, and have similar "Fast" variants, but that too is beyond the scope here for now.
