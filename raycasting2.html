<h2><a name="Introduction" id="Introduction"></a>Introduction<br /></h2>
In the previous raycasting article was shown how to render flat untextured walls, and how to render textured ones. The floor and ceiling have always
remained flat and untextured however. If you want to keep the floor and ceiling untextured, no extra code is needed, but to have them textured too,
more calculations are needed.<br />
Wolfenstein 3D didn't have floor or ceiling textures, but some other raycasting games that followed soon after Wolf3D had them, for example Blake Stone 3D:<br />
<br />

<br />You can download the full source code of this tutorial <a href="files/raycaster_floor.cpp">here</a>.
<h2><a name="Howitworks" id="Howitworks"></a>How it Works</h2>
Unlike the wall textures, the floor and ceiling textures are horizontal
so they can't be drawn the same way as the wall with vertical stripes. Instead, they're drawn with horizontal scanlines.
The perspective is similar to that of walls but 90 degrees rotated, but unlike the walls which used exactly 1 texture
per vertical stripes, multiple floor textures (or the same one repeatedly) may cross our horizontal line.
<p/>
Drawing the ceiling happens the same way as drawing the floor, so only the floor is explained here.
<p/>
The floor casting is done before the walls, so first we draw the entire floor (and ceiling), then overwrite part of
the pixels with the walls, as before, in the next step.
<br />
In short, the floor casting works as follows: work scanline by scanline. For the current scanline,
compute the position on the floor matching the left pixel of the scanline, and the position matching the
right pixel. This can be computed as where the ray starting from the camera, going through that pixel of the
camera plane, hits the floor. The formulas and explanation for this are in the floor casting code further below.<br />
<br />
We can then linearly interpolate between this leftmost and rightmost point to get the floor coordinates matching the
other pi xels of this scanline. This works because the floor texture is perfectly horizontal. If it were slanted, we
would need to do more expensive perspective correct texture mapping instead.
<p/>
NOTE: Ádám Tóth contributed the idea and demo code for the horizontal scanline technique in 2019. Before this, this tutorial described a vertical stripe based technique, but the horizontal technique is faster and matches how raycasting games really worked. The vertical technique is moved to a separate chapter at the end.

<p/>
<h2><a name="Code" id="Code"></a>The Code</h2>
The code tries to load the wolfenstein textures from the previous raycasting tutorial, you can download them <a href="files/wolftex.zip">here (copyright
by id Software)</a>.
If you don't want to load textures, you can use the part of code that generates textures from the previous raycasting tutorial instead, but
it looks less good.<br />
<br /><img alt="" src="images/wolftextures.png" style="width: 512px; height: 64px;" /><br />
<br />
The first part of the code is exactly the same as in the previous raycasting tutorial, but is given here to situate where the new code will be. There's also a new map. This piece of code declares all needed variables, loads the textures, and draws textured vertical wall stripes. For the loading of the textures, please see the previous raycasting tutorial about getting the images or using an alternative way to generate the textures.<br />

Now comes the new floor casting code, going line by line instead of vertical
stripe by vertical stripe.
<p/>
The formula for rowDistance, the horizontal distance from camera to the floor
for the current row, which is posZ / p with p the current pixel distance from
the screen center, can be explained as follows:
<p/>
The camera ray goes through the following two points: the camera itself,
which is at a certain height (posZ), and a point in front of the camera (through an imagined
vertical plane containing the screen pixels) with horizontal distance
1 from the camera, and vertical position p lower than posZ (posZ - p). When going
through that point, the line has vertically traveled by p units and
horizontally by 1 unit. To hit the floor, it instead needs to travel by
posZ units. It will travel the same ratio horizontally. The ratio was
1 / p for going through the camera plane, so to go posZ times farther
to reach the floor, we get that the total horizontal distance is posZ / p.
<p/>
NOTE: The stepping being done here is affine texture mapping, which means we can
interpolate linearly between two points rather than have to compute a different
division for each pixel. This is not perspective correct in general, but for
perfectly horizontal floors/ceilings (and also perfectly vertical walls) it is,
so we can use it for raycasting.

<br />
<img alt="" src="images/raycastfloor.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /><br />
<br />
This raycaster is very slow at high resolutions and certainly has room for optimizations.
<h2><a name="Tricks" id="Tricks"></a>Special Tricks</h2>
These tricks actually aren't that special, it's just things that you can modify to get other results.<br />
<br />
To resize the floor and ceiling textures, for example to make them 4 times larger, you can modify this part of the code:<br />
<br />

<center><table class="codetable"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">        int floorTexX, floorTexY;
        floorTexX = int(currentFloorX * texWidth) % texWidth;
        floorTexY = int(currentFloorY * texHeight) % texHeight;</span></pre>

        floorTexX = int(currentFloorX * texWidth / 4) % texWidth;

<br />
<img alt="" src="images/raycastfloorresize.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;" /><br />
<br />
So far, the whole level had the same floor texture everywhere. Since, in the way the level is described,
all non-walls have code 0, this can't be used to give each square its own floortile texture. You could
make non-wall tiles 0 or negative instead, then while raycasting a negative number means no wall, and the
value can be used to say what floor texture has to be used there. If you want to do the same with the ceiling,
you'd need another value for the ceiling textures too, so you could also consider using a separate map for
the walls, floor and ceiling. Instead of doing that, here will now be
demonstrated how to give each tile its own texture based on its coordinates: if the sum of its x and y
coordinate on the map is even, it gets texture 3, if it's odd, it gets texture 4, this will give a checkerboard
pattern.<br />
<br />To get the x and y coordinate of the current tile in the map, take the integer part of currentFloorX and
currentFloorY. To get this, the for loop of the floor casting part is changed into this (the bold parts are new
or changed):<br />
<br />

<center><table class="codetable"><tr><td style="vertical-align: top;">
<pre><span class="code">      //draw the floor from drawEnd to the bottom of the screen
      for(int y = drawEnd + 1; y < h; y++)
      {
        currentDist = h / (2.0 * y - h); //you could make a small lookup table for this instead

        double weight = (currentDist - distPlayer) / (distWall - distPlayer);

        double currentFloorX = weight * floorXWall + (1.0 - weight) * posX;

<br />
In a similar way, it's also possible to choose the floor texture for each tile based on a map instead. The integer part of currentFloorX gives the coordinates of the current floortile in the map, while the fractional part gives the coordinate of the texel on the texture.<br />
<br />
If you modify the checkerboard code from "<span class="inlinecode">(int(currentFloorX) + int(currentFloorY)) % 2</span>" into "<span class="inlinecode">(int(currentFloorX + currentFloorY)) % 2</span>",
you don't get a checkerboard pattern but diagonal stripes instead, because now the fractional parts are added as well.<br />

<h2><a name="Vertical" id="Vertical"></a>Vertical Version</h2>
As an alternative to the horizontal scanline based floor casting technique described above, it's also possible to work vertically.
This allows to continue drawing the same vertical stripe a current wall stripe was drawn. However, this technique is slower because
it requires perspective correct texture mapping, doing a division for every single pixel. In addition, the scanline based technique
is also faster because scanline order is faster to render thanks to locality for memory caching.
<p/>
The result looks the same (the floors are still horizontal), it's just rendered in a different way.
<p/>
This technique works as follows: after you've drawn a vertical stripe from the wall,
you do the floor casting for every pixel below the bottom wall pixel until the bottom of the screen.
You need to know the exact coordinates of two points of the floor that are inside the current stripe,
two such points that can easily be found are: the position of the player, and, the point of the floor
right in front of the wall. Then, for every pixel, calculate the distance its projection on the floor
has to the player. With that distance, you can find the exact location of the floor that pixel
represents by using linear interpolation between the two points you found (the one at the wall and the
one at your position).<br />
<br />Once you've done all the floor calculations, out of the exact position you can easily find
the coordinates of the texel from the texture to get the color of the pixel you need to draw.
Because the floor and ceiling are symmetrical, you know the texel coordinates of the ceiling
texture are the same, you just draw it at the corresponding pixel in the upper half of the screen
instead and can use a different texture for the ceiling and the floor.<br />
<br />
The distance the projection of the current pixel is to the floor can be calculated as follows:
<ul>
<li>If the pixel is in the center of the screen (in vertical direction), the distance is infinite.</li>
<li>If the pixel is at the bottom of the screen, you can choose a certain distance, for example 1</li>
<li>So all the pixels between those are between 1 and infinite, the distance the pixel represents in function
of its height in the bottom half of the screen is inversely related as 1 / height. You can use the formula
"currentDist = h / (2.0 * y - h)" for the distance of the current pixel.</li>
<li>You can also precalculate a lookup table for this instead,
since there are only h / 2 possible values (one half of the screen in vertical direction).</li>
</ul>
The linear interpolation, to get the exact floor location based on the current distance and the two known distances,
can be done with a weight factor. This weight factor is "weight = (currentDist - distPlayer) / (distWall - distPlayer)",
and since the current pixel will always be between the wall and the position of the player, the exact position is then:
"currentFloorPos = weight * floorPosWall + (1.0 - weight) * playerPos". Note that distPlayer is actually 0, so the weight
is actually "currentDist / distWall".<br />
<br />


<br />
The code is not given in full this time, the floor casting is now done right after the wall casting, in the same x-loop. Don't forget to remove or disable the other floor casting code before adding this.
<br />
<br />
Right after the walls are drawn, the floor casting can begin. First the position of the floor
right in front of the wall is calculated, and there are 4 different cases possible depending
if a north, east, south or west side of a wall was hit. After this position and the distances
are set, the for loop in the y direction that goes from the pixel below the wall until the bottom
of the screen starts, it calculates the current distance, out of that the weight, out of
that the exact position of the floor, and out of that the texel coordinate on the texture.
With this info, both a floor and a ceiling pixel can be drawn. The floor is made darker.<br />
